  <h1>will you let me court you</h1>

  <p>i don’t want to rush anything. i know we’ve come a long way, and i’ve been holding this in for some time now. i’ve always imagined us becoming something more, and i think i’m finally ready to say this.</p>

  <p>there’s something i’ve been wanting to ask you. not because i want to change what we have too fast, but because i want to take a step forward, slowly and sincerely.</p>

  <p>will you allow me to court you</p>

  <p>whatever your answer is, whether it’s a yes or a no, i’ll accept it wholeheartedly. if it’s no, i’ll respect it and still be grateful for what we’ve shared so far. but if it’s yes, then i know it’s something i’ll treasure for the rest of my life.</p>

  <p>i’m not asking for anything instant. i’m not expecting things to change overnight. i just want you to know that i’m willing to take my time. i’m willing to wait, no matter how long, because i believe you’re worth it.</p>

  <p>i cherish everything about you, and everything about us. the moments, the conversations, even the quiet times. they all mean so much to me.</p>

  <p>i’ve come to care about you more than i ever expected. there’s a kind of peace i find when i talk to you, and a kind of warmth i don’t feel anywhere else. you make the little things feel like everything.</p>

  <p>i don’t want to take that for granted. i want to nurture it, protect it, and maybe if you let me, let it grow into something even more real.</p>

  <p>no matter what happens, i’ll always be here for you. whether it leads to something more or not, you’ll always have someone who genuinely cares.</p>

  <p>but if i’m being honest, it’s you i want. it’s you i choose. and if i could, i’d choose you every time.</p>

  <p>it’s either us, or no one.</p>
